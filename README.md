# Python Backend with Flask Notes

## Python Notes

1. A dynamic array is a linear data structure. Elements can be added/removed/moved in dynamic array. Main properties are: size, and capacity.
2. Time complexity of adding an element is O(n), updating is O(1), removing is O(n).
3. If dynamic array exceeds its capacity, all elements will be copied to a new internal array of a bigger size.
4. If scaling factor of dynamic array is x, then when the array fills to max capacity, the new capacity will multiply by x of the previous capacity and not the initial capacity.
5. Assume you have a dynamic array with an initial size and capacity of 2, and the scaling factor is 2. What is the minimum number of additional elements you need to insert to increase the capacity to 1024? ANS: 511 (1024-free_capacity/scaling_factor).
6. *args: Used to pass a variable number of positional arguments (i.e., unnamed arguments).
7. **kwargs: Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments (i.e., named arguments).
8. Python encourages using default arguments and variable-length arguments **(\*args and \*\*kwargs)** to achieve similar functionality as method overloading.
9. Docstring: It is a string literal. It is written as the first statement in the definition of a module, a class, a method, a function, etc., and briefly describes its behavior and how you can use it, what parameters you should pass to the function. Two types of docstrings are: one-liners and multi-liners.
10. Under PEP 257, you should follow the next conventions for docstrings for functions and methods:
       1. The opening and the closing quotes should be on the same line.
       2. There should be no empty strings either before or after the docstring.
       3. Your description should be imperative, that's why we need the wordings like """Return the factorial.""" or """Return the number.""" instead of """Returns the number.""" or """It returns the number.""".
       4. The description is not a scheme that repeats the object's parameters and return values, like """count_factorial(num) -> int.""".
11. If backslash is contained in a docstring then we should use *r* prefix such as `r"""A \new example with \triple double-quotes."""`
12. A set is an unordered container of hashable objects.
13. Immutable data types can be elements of a set. They **do not** record element position. `set()` function is used to void repetitions.
14. The only difference between `set` and `frozenset` is that set is a mutable data type, but frozenset is not. To create a frozenset, we use the `frozenset()` function.
15. Python does not support method overloading as it is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables types are determined at runtime rather than compile-time.
16. Inheritance:

                  # inheritance syntax
                  class ChildClass(ParentClass):
                        # methods and attributes
                        ...
       Here, ChildClass is the subclass of ParentClass. Inheritance can be of 2 types: **Single** and **Multiple**
17. We can check type of an object by using `type(object) or type(object, bases, dict)` and `isinstance(object, type)`. `isinstance(object, type)` allows us to check for the immediate type of object but also with the parent type and also it would work with the parent of parent type [consider inheritance] whereas `type(object)` only allows us to check for the immediate type of the object [does not consider inheritance].
18. `type(object)` checks for the exact type of the object, while `isinstance(object, type)` checks if the object is an instance of a class or its subclass.
19. **Overriding:** Any object-oriented programming language can allow a subclass or child class to offer a customized implementation of a method already supplied by one of its superclasses or parent classes.
20. super(): Used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class. Returns an (proxy,or temporary) object of the parent class. Example: See super_method.py, super_method2.py,super_method3.py file.
21. Functions in `os` module:
      1. `os.getcwd()` to learn (or gets) the current working directory and `os.chdir()` to change it.
      2. `os.mkdir()` to create a single directory and `os.makedirs()` to create nested folders.
      3. `os.listdir()` to get listing of the directory's content and `os.rename()` to create the name of files and folders.
22. **unittest module:** Tool for writing tests. `unittest.TestCase` class has different methods: <br>
        1.  `assertEqual(a, b)` => a == b <br>
        2.  `assertNotEqual(a, b)` => a != b <br>
        3.  `assertTrue(x)` => bool(x) is True <br>
        4.  `assertFalse(x)` => bool(x) is False <br>
        5.  `assertIsNone(x)` => x is None <br>
        6.  `assertIsNotNone(x)` => x is not None <br>
        7.  `assertGreater(a, b)` => a > b <br>
        8.  `assertLess(a, b)` => a < b <br>
        9.  `assertIsInstance(a, b)` => isinstance(a, b) <br>
        10. `assertRaises(exception, function, arguments)` => Raises the exception when given the arguments
23. `setUp()` method is executed *before every* test method and the code inside.
24. `tearDown()` method is executed *after every* test method.
25. We can get details for each test method by typing `-v`, or stop the tests after the first failure or error by typing `-f` in the command line.
26. Unpacking Operators: THese are at the left of `=` operator. Using single asterik (*) or double asteriks (**) we can unpack elements from tuple, lists, dictionaries. Double can get *values* of dictionary but single can get only *keys*. See Unpacking.py for more.
27. Context Managers: Used to close the files opened at right time and also release the descriptor when done using the file. See 

## Web Technologies Notes

1. Standard Status codes:
        1. 1xx: Informational
        2. 2xx: Success
        3. 3xx: Redirection
        4. 4xx: Client Error
        5. 5xx: Server Error
2. HTTP Methods: GET, POST, HEAD
3. **REST (Representational State Transfer):** REST is NOT a protocol or a standard. REST usually works on top of HTTP and is one of the possible ways to use HTTP. It is not a standard, but rather a set of useful recommendations. A service (or app) that follows REST rules is called **RESTful**.
4. 6 **REST** principles:
      1. Client-server interaction model
      2. Stateless
      3. Cacheable
      4. Uniform interface
      5. Layered system
      6. Code on demand [optional]
5. HTTP methods for RESTful services:
      1. POST => To create new resources.
      2. GET => Retrieve or read the resource.
      3. PUT => Either creates a resource by the specified ID or updates an existing one.
      4. DELETE => To remove a resource identified by a specific URI (ID).

## UI Notes

1. Features of UX:
      1. Interaction Design
      2. Wireframes & Prototypes
      3. Information Architecture
      4. Senarios
      5. Focus on Interactions
2. Features of UI:
      1. Visual Design
      2. Color Palette
      3. Layouts
      4. Typography
      5. Focus on Tools
3. Layout Grids: Grids use columns to mark up the screen and margins to measure the distance from the edge of the screen. Gutters are also used between columns to visually separate elements from each other, such as ensuring that buttons don't overlap.
4. Common Layout Grids: ScrollView, FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, GridLayout.

## Flask Notes

1. `make_response` function which handles simple responses. 
2. `jsonify` function is used to convert Python objects (like dictionaries or lists) into proper JSON responses. **jsonify** automatically sets the Content-Type header of the response to 'application/json'. This tells the client that the response body contains JSON data.

## SQL Notes

1. E-R diagrams: used for visual display of the structure of relational database: **entity**,**relationship** and **attribute**.
2. Levels of database design:
      1. Conceptual (semantic): structure is clear and understadable for all users, developers and customers.
      2. Logical: Structure is converted to some model (most often relational). In many CASE (computer aided software engineering)tools, the conceptual and logical layers are combined.
      3. Physical: DB model is presented in the form in which it should be described in a specific DBMS. For example, archar2 â€“ oracle.
3. Types of keys:
      1. Primary key: uniquely defines the entity (for each row in the table it is different / cannot be repeated). For example, a passport number.
      2. Foreign key: It is the primary key of one entity, which is needed to communicate with another entity (it can be repeated).
4. Different types of connections:
      1. one-to-one (1-1): for example, passport-citizen
      2. one-to-many (1-M): for example, student-group
      3. many-to-many (M-M): for example, student-subjects
5. Different types of links:
      1. identifying (solid line): Primary key of one entity (main) goes into the primary key, which is also a foreign key to another entity (dependent). Dependent entities are those entities that depend on other entities (parent/main). For example, a citizen (dependent) cannot exist without a passport (main).
      2. non-identifying (dashed line): Primary key of one entity does not go into the primary key of another entity but becomes a non-key attribute (like a foreign key). For example, a student and a group: the student may not have a group number assigned.
6. Normalization: improving the properties of a database by sequentially dividing one table into several tables. Reason is presence of anomalies in unnormalized database. (An anomaly is a situation in which there is a complication of data processing and a violation of consistency, i.e. the correctness or adequacy of information storage)
7. Types of normal forms:
      1. First normal form (1NF): When all data in its cells are atomic i.e simple and non-separable.
      2. Second normal form (2NF): It is based on **functional dependance**. It is more of a semantic concept and is denoted as **x->y** (read as x functionally defines y, or y is functionally dependent on x). For example, x1->y1, x1->y2 then y1 = y2. Here x is **dependency determinant**.

## MYSQL Notes

1. schema/structures: design using columns
2. individual data: rows
3.
